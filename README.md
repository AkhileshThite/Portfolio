# [Project 2 | Classification: MAGIC Gamma Telescope](https://github.com/AkhileshThite/MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope)
• It is used to find the "cosmic source" by registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using imaging technique.

• I tested all the classification algorithms and finally got the best results with **99.98%** accuracy by using **"Random Forest Classification"**. And then distinguished gamma rays (signal) from hadronic showers (background) for the further studies.

# [Project 3 | Clustering: Mall Customers](https://github.com/AkhileshThite/K-Means-Clustering)
• The dataset contains some customer information of a mall along with their mall spending time (entries).

• I've successfully separated all the customers into groups by using **"K-means clusturing"** algorithm, So advertisers can target a specific group of customers to increase the profits of the mall.
