# [Project 1 | Advanced Regression Techniques: House Prices](https://github.com/AkhileshThite/Advanced-Regression-Techniques-House-Prices)
• This data set describes the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa, USA from 2006 to 2010. The data set contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous) involved in assessing home values.

• With **Feature Engineering and Advanced Regression Techniques** such as **“Random Forest Regression” & “XGBoost”** I’ve accurately predicted the sales price for each house.

# [Project 2 | Classification: MAGIC Gamma Telescope](https://github.com/AkhileshThite/MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope)
• It is used to find the "cosmic source" by registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using imaging technique.

• I tested all the classification algorithms and finally got the best results with **99.98%** accuracy by using **"Random Forest Classification"**. And then distinguished gamma rays (signal) from hadronic showers (background) for the further studies.

# [Project 3 | Clustering: Mall Customers](https://github.com/AkhileshThite/K-Means-Clustering)
• The dataset contains some customer information of a mall along with their mall spending time (entries).

• I've successfully separated all the customers into groups by using **"K-means clusturing"** algorithm, So advertisers can target a specific group of customers to increase the profits of the mall.

# [Project 4 | Deep Learning (ANN): Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/AkhileshThite/Deep-Learning-ANN-Heart-Disease-Prediction)
• This dataset contains health information of patients in Cleveland, Ohio. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

• With the help of ANN we can efficiently distinguish the presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).
