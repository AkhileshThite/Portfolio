# [Project 1 | Classification: MAGIC Gamma Telescope](https://github.com/AkhileshThite/MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope)
• It is used to find the "cosmic source" by registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using imaging technique.

• I tested all the classification algorithms and finally got the best results with **99.98%** accuracy by using **"Random Forest Classification"**. And then distinguished gamma rays (signal) from hadronic showers (background) for the further studies.

# [Project 2 | Clustering: Mall Customers](https://github.com/AkhileshThite/K-Means-Clustering)
• The dataset contains some customer information of a mall along with their mall spending time (entries).

• I've successfully separated all the customers into groups by using **"K-means clusturing"** algorithm, So advertisers can target a specific group of customers to increase the profits of the mall.

# [Project 3 | Deep Learning: Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame](https://github.com/AkhileshThite/Tic-Tac-Toe-Endgame)
• This dataset encodes the complete set of possible board configurations at the end of tic-tac-toe games, where "x" is assumed to have played first. The target concept is "win for x". I got 98.44% accuracy by using **"Artificial Neural Network"**.

# [Project 4 | Regression: India's Population](https://github.com/AkhileshThite/Simple-Linear-Regression) 
• I've built a model that can predict India's population with 99.3% accuracy by using **"Simple Linear Regression"** algorithm. 
Python libraries- numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and scikit-learn.
